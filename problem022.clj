;; Problem 22

;; Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),
;; a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names,
;; begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out
;; the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value
;; by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

;; For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order,
;; COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th
;; name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

;; What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
